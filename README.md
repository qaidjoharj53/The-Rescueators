# The-Rescueators
Our project uses remote sensing and machine learning techniques to analyze the impact of the 2016 Manipur earthquake in northeast India. This region, known for its seismic activity, experienced significant damage due to the earthquake, affecting infrastructure, livelihoods, and the natural environment. By utilizing high-resolution satellite imagery from sources such as Sentinel-2, we aim to assess the extent of the damage, monitor recovery efforts, and provide valuable insights for future disaster management and mitigation strategies. This project analyzes changes in the affected areas before and after the earthquake.
